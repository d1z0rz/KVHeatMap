# KVHeatMap
Once in the evening, when I was having lunch, I thought, that estonian real estate buy-sell sites do not have heatmaps.
After several minutes, I have started my project.
Before you start, make sure, that you have all of these libraries:
flask; flask_restful; urllib; bs4; geocoder; pickle; tinydb; json; tkinter
to quick install use:
pip3 install flack flack_restful urllib bs4 geocoder pickle tinydb json tkinter
After seeing my program put star on github page https://github.com/d1z0rz/KVHeatMap :)
1. Launch main.py and after choose city to download database.
  Then it done, go to the next stage.
2. Launch server.py and enter to the search line in the browser:
  127.0.0.1:5000/test.
  If you use MacOS, press cmd+a and then ctrl+c.
  Else you use  ctrl+a and ctrl+c.
3. Launch browser with enabled JavaScript, put to the search line:
  https://codepen.io/d1z0r/pen/vvLmea?fbclid=IwAR2MFVBDUiv29z9GSKsWe96GxXGNvSFpOvupWwNrx7Sy7sUPBg_LiDZIXuQ
  In JS block, replace var data to the result, that you have got in cache.
4. See result and choose real estate. :)
